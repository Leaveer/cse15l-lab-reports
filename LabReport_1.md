# Lab Report 1

## Part 1 – Meet Your Group!

I meet my 5 groupmembers! They all use their own computer, but I'm using school's computer.

## Part 2 – Your CSE15L Account

I created my account and transfer to CSE unique account, then reset password. I followed up the direction of [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view), and use the [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)to enter the account.

## Part 3 – Visual Studio Code

I tried to installed the Visual Studio and GitBash. But since I'm using the school's computer I don't need to install it. I used link[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download the Visual Studio and use[Link](https://gitforwindows.org/) to download the Git.

## Part 4 – Remotely Connecting

I failed on remote due on the first try because I didn't open GitBash inside of the VS. But I still successfully did it in the GitBash, then I realize I don't need to verify it again in the VS.

## Part 5 – Run Some Commands

I run most of the codes successfully, but there are some problems happened at the last few codes. The files doesn't exist, so the last few codes didn't run successfully, tutor said we don't need to worry about it now.

cd ~: change directory to root folder
cd: change directory, since there are nothing behind then it didn't do anything
ls -lat: List the files inside of lat
ls -a: List the files inside of a
ls <directory>: error, because I forgot to change the diection to the floder that has directory
cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/ &
cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt: Both missing files, TA says no worry with that.

## Part 6 – git, Github, and Github Pages

Github is really useful to help us connect with different devices.
  
## Part 7 – Creating a Website with Github Pages

Github is really useful, I created an account and a web page. I make a webpage with "HelloWorld!" which looks exactly like the instruction, and named it as"cse15l-lab-reports". It only contents one line of code with "Hello, world!", and later on I will add other things inside then print and pdf, finally submit it as this pdf.
