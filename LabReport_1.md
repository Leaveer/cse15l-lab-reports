I failed on remote due on the first try because I didn't open GitBash inside of the VS. But I still successfully did it in the GitBash, then I realize I don't need to verify it again in the VS.

I run most of the codes successfully, but there are some problems happened at the last few codes. The files doesn't exist, so the last few codes didn't run successfully, tutor said we don't need to worry about it now.
